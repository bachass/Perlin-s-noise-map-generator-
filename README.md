# Perlin-s-noise-map-generator-
This script generates a 2D terrain map using Perlin noise.
The map is represented as a 2D NumPy array, where each cell represents a terrain type (water, sand, grass, or forest).  The script uses the PerlinNoise class from the perlin_noise library to generate noise values for each cell in the map. The noise values are then used to determine the terrain type for each cell.  The map is then visualized using Matplotlib, with different colors representing different terrain types.  
Key Features:  
Generates a 2D terrain map using Perlin noise 
Supports multiple terrain types (water, sand, grass, and forest) 
Visualizes the map using Matplotlib 
Allows for customization of map size, noise scale, and terrain types
